Four legendary figures harnessed these souls, three of which used this power to defeat the ancient dragons and ushered in the age of fire. The flame brought immense power and prosperity to kingdoms and armies. However, over time, the flame started to deplete, leaving only two choices - to let it fade away, marking the onset of the Age of Dark, or to extend the Age of Flame by sacrificing a chosen one's life. Now, it's your quest, and you have the power to make your own decision. Defeat those who hold the souls of the first flame and choose the path that aligns with your beliefs.",
